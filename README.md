## Benchmarking the spontaneous functional and neurological recovery following spinal cord injury
Traumatic spinal cord injury is a rare but devastating neurological disorder. It constitutes a major public health issue, burdening both patients, caregivers, as well as society on a whole. The goal of this project is to establish an international benchmark for neurological and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Currently, Neurosurveillance leverages three decades of data from two of the largest data sources in the field facilitating the analysis of temporal trends in epidemiological landscape, providing reference values for future clinical trials and studies, and enabling monitoring of patients on a personalized level.

## What You Can Do There:
This applet has **three main interactive sections** that enable visitors to directly interact with the data collected in the EMSCI study and the Sygen clinical trial:
+ The **Data Sources Tab** provides information the two data sources, namely EMSCI study and the Sygen clinical trial.
+ The **Visualization Tab** offers an interactive interface to explore the functional and neurological recovery after spinal cord injury. You can choose the data source, outcome variable of interest, select the cohort of interest based in demographics and injury characteristics (entire cohort or a subset thereof), and chose the variables for the visualization.
+ The **Monitoring Tab** gives you the possibility to visualize and monitor the neurological and functional recovery trajectory of single patients or patient groups that share very similar demographics and baseline injury characteristics. As an example, if you have a patient in the clinical with a certain motor score and you are interested in their recovery, you can have a look at previous patients with comparable characteristics. This follows the concept of a digital twin/sibling.
+ The **Abbreviation Tab** describes the abbreviations used within the framework of this applet.
